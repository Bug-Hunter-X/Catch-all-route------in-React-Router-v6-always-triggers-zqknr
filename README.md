This repository demonstrates a bug in React Router v6 where a catch-all route (`/*`) in `Routes` always triggers, regardless of whether a matching route exists.  The issue stems from the order of route definitions.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly position the catch-all route to function as intended.  The bug is present in React Router DOM v6.  The solution is verified to work.
